Breadth–first search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores vertices in the

order of their distance from the source vertex,where distance is the minimum length of a path from the source vertex to the node.

**1. BFS Algorithm Complexity**

The time complexity of the BFS algorithm is represented in the form of O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(V).
 mark and enqueue all (unvisited) neighbours of u

Algorithm BFS(G, v)

    create Q ← new empty FIFO queue
    
    Mark v as visited .
  
    Q.enqueue(v)   //put v in into Q 
    
    while Q is not empty
        
        u ← Q.dequeue() //remove the head  u of Q
        
        // Perform some operation on u.
        
        for all unvisited neighbors x of u
        
            Mark x as visited.
            
            Q.enqueue(x) // put x into Q
